Sitarcoin (STC)
===============

This coin is a fork of SmallChange (SMC), available at https://github.com/bfroemel/smallchange.

This coin is used to buy sitars (RichG, the lead dev, has no sitars, so do not PM him with offers).

<b>This coin is for fun. :)</b>

Blocks
======

There are approx. 16.7 million blocks. The blocks are 15 seconds apart, and there are 1.25 coins per block. The coins will be mineable for 2 years (I said this was for fun).

Ports
=====

<b>RPC:</b> 37375<br/>
<b>P2P:</b> 37374<br/>
<b>Testnet P2P:</b> 37373<br/>

Mining
======

Sitarcoin is a Scrypt-based coin, so be sure to turn on Scrypt when mining. Here's an example of solo mining: <br/>
<p>
<code>
cgminer -o http://localhost:37375 -u SitarcoinRocks -p password -I 15 --scrypt
</code>
</p>
<p>
Happy fun mining :)<br/>
